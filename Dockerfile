# Bootstrap on every container start:
# 1. seed-cards — idempotent INSERT-or-UPDATE of the 5 launch card_definitions
#    rows. Cheap; runs even if rows already exist.
# 2. load-eval-spec — pulls real per-card content from the public
#    cathedral-eval-spec GitHub repo and updates the rows. Idempotent.
#    Failure is non-fatal (logs to stderr, container still starts) — we'd
#    rather serve placeholder content than refuse to start.
# 3. serve — start uvicorn + the FastAPI app + background eval orchestrator.
