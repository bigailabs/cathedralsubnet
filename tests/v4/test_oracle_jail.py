"""Filesystem jail regression tests for the publisher-side oracle.

Finding 1 of the PR #133 review: Fred's local probe showed that a
miner patch could read ``/etc/hosts`` during hidden-test import and
leak its contents through stdout. The fix is the Linux fs-jail
(``cathedral.v4.oracle.jail``); these tests pin two contracts:

  1. ``test_jail_blocks_etc_hosts_read`` -- on Linux the jail makes
     ``/etc/hosts`` unreachable from the child (ENOENT) and no
     plausible contents (``localhost`` / ``127.0.0.1``) appear in
     stdout / stderr. Skipped on non-Linux because the jail is a
     Linux-only mechanism; the production startup check refuses to
     run a publisher-class workload on macOS.
  2. ``test_assert_production_isolation_refuses_monkeypatch`` --
     when ``CATHEDRAL_V4_ENV=production`` and the resolved mode is
     ``monkeypatch_only`` (the macOS dev posture), the runner's
     startup check raises ``RuntimeError`` rather than silently
     downgrading. Verified on every platform because the function
     is platform-independent CPU code.

The jail test is structurally complete on macOS even though it is
skipped: it can be executed verbatim on a Linux CI runner (or any
Linux box) to confirm the regression is fixed.
