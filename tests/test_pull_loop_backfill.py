"""Regression tests for the pull-loop backfill window.

cathedralai/cathedral#105 changed `weight_loop` to compute a 7-day
rolling mean per hotkey, but `pull_loop` seeded its initial cursor at
``now - 1 hour``. A fresh or restarted validator never hydrated the rest
of the 7-day window before its first ``set_weights`` call, so Cathedral
validators on SN39 produced different ``weights_pre_burn`` vectors
depending on how long they'd been running.

A first attempt at the fix (PR #109 first pass) used `max(ran_at)` from
local DB to pick the cursor. That was wrong for the upgrade path:
existing validators with recent rows from the old `now - 1h` cursor
would resume from those recent rows and never walk the older end of the
new 7-day window. So Rizzo/Kraken/RT21 stayed divergent from TAO.com.

The current fix uses a **durable marker** in a new ``pull_loop_meta``
table: until a validator records that it has completed a 7-day backfill
under the current code version, every startup forces a seed at
``now - 7 days`` regardless of what's in ``pulled_eval_runs``. After
the first drained catch-up pass the marker is written, so subsequent
restarts use the cheap resume-from-local-max path.

This module pins:

1. Fresh DB → cursor seeds at ``now - 7 days``.
2. **Upgrade case**: DB has recent rows but no marker → still seed at
   ``now - 7 days``. This is the load-bearing case.
3. Marker present and fresh row inside window → resume from
   ``max(ran_at)``.
4. Marker present but max row older than window → reseed at
   ``now - 7 days``.
5. Repeated startup with marker present does not duplicate rows or
   skew score aggregates.
6. End-to-end: fresh validator backfill hydrates the weight window.
