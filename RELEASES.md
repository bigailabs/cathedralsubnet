# Releases

Canonical release notes for the Cathedral subnet. Mirrored to GitHub at
[github.com/cathedralai/cathedral/releases](https://github.com/cathedralai/cathedral/releases).

Versioning follows the runtime image: `v<major>.<minor>.<patch>` tracks
`docker/cathedral-runtime/CATHEDRAL_RUNTIME_VERSION`. A new tag is cut
whenever the producer-side surface changes in a way miners or validators
need to know about.

## v1.1.19 - protective mainnet burn while v3 corpus hardens

**Date:** 2026-05-17

**Headline:** Mainnet validator policy routes 95% of SN39 weight to the
subnet owner burn uid until the v3 `bug_isolation_v1` corpus produces
launch-grade per-miner signal.

### Changed

- **Mainnet forced burn restored to 95%.** `config/mainnet.toml` now
  sets `forced_burn_percentage = 95.0`, leaving 5% for measured miner
  signal while the current v1 EU AI Act lane is too saturated to
  discriminate miner quality at scale.
- **Managed SN39 config sync follows the release policy.**
  `MAINNET_FORCED_BURN_PERCENTAGE` is now `95.0`, so managed validator
  startups rewrite stale SN39 mainnet configs back to the protective
  burn setting after signed-tag updates.

### Operator note

- No v3 feed or v3 weight change is included in this release.
  `CATHEDRAL_V3_FEED_ENABLED` remains off and
  `v3_bug_isolation_weight` remains `0.0`.
- Revert this burn percentage toward `0.0` only after a real
  `bug_isolation_v1` testnet E2E produces signed rows and validator
  pull verification, and after the private corpus passes red-team
  challenge checks.

## v1.1.18 - v3 bug isolation wiring + private corpus loader (feed off)

**Date:** 2026-05-16

**Headline:** Validator + publisher now ship the full v3
`bug_isolation_v1` lane, with the corpus loaded from operator-private
storage at runtime. The lane stays inert until the publisher
operator sets `CATHEDRAL_V3_CORPUS_PATH`, restarts, and flips
`CATHEDRAL_V3_FEED_ENABLED=true`. No miner-side or validator-side
action required for this tag beyond upgrading.

### Added

- **v3 `bug_isolation_v1` orchestrator lane (#128).** The publisher's
  SSH Hermes path now dispatches a bug-isolation challenge after a
  full EU AI Act eval completes, scores the miner's structured claim
  statically against a hidden oracle, signs the result under schema
  v3, and persists it. Validators with the new keyset accept and
  pull these rows. Gated behind `CATHEDRAL_V3_FEED_ENABLED` (default
  off); production corpus also empty by default, so no real v3 jobs
  run after upgrade until the operator opts in.
- **`epoch_salt` bound into the v3 signed payload (#128).** The salt
  that derives `challenge_id_public` is now part of the signed
  subset, so a man-in-the-middle cannot relabel the epoch a row came
  from while keeping the public id intact for cross-epoch
  answer-sharing.
- **Private corpus loader (#130).** Real challenge rows are a hidden
  oracle and live entirely outside this public repo.
  `cathedral.v3.corpus.private_loader.load_private_corpus()` reads
  operator-curated JSON from the path in `CATHEDRAL_V3_CORPUS_PATH`,
  validates each entry through `ChallengeRow.model_validate(...)`,
  rejects `UNVERIFIED_` ids and `swebench`/`SWE-bench` source
  markers, and caches in-process. `PILOT_CORPUS` in `seed_pilot.py`
  is permanently `()`.
- **Boot-time corpus preload (#130).** Publisher lifespan now calls
  the loader at startup whenever `CATHEDRAL_V3_CORPUS_PATH` is set,
  so the operator's preflight check (`corpus_loaded path=... rows=N`
  in the boot logs) succeeds independently of the feed flag.
- **`CATHEDRAL_V3_BUG_ISOLATION_WEIGHT` blending env (#128).** Lets
  validator operators dial v3's contribution to the per-hotkey
  weight blend without a code change. Defaults to `0.0`, holding v3
  at zero weight until each operator explicitly opts in.

### Changed

- **v3 keyset locked in three mirrors.** The signed-payload keyset
  for `eval_output_schema_version=3` is asserted byte-equal across
  `cathedral.v3.sign._V3_SIGNED_KEYS`,
  `cathedral.eval.v2_payload._SIGNED_KEYS_BY_VERSION[3]`, and
  `cathedral.validator.pull_loop._SIGNED_KEYS_BY_VERSION[3]` by
  tests. Future drift will fail CI loudly rather than break verify
  silently in the field.
- **Latency anomaly handling in the validator pull loop.** v3 rows
  are bucketed v1 vs v3 in `latest_pulled_score_per_hotkey` instead
  of mean-of-means by task_type. Historical `task_type='unknown'`
  rows no longer get inflated weight against newly-typed entries.

### For validator operators

Upgrade as usual; the `cathedral-updater` PM2 app will pick up this
signed tag automatically. No env or config changes required to stay
at parity. **Do not** set `CATHEDRAL_V3_BUG_ISOLATION_WEIGHT` above
`0.0` until a separate operator DM gives you the go-ahead; v3 has
not yet been exercised end-to-end on testnet.

### For miners

No action required. The v3 lane stays off across the fleet at this
tag. A future tag will document the miner-visible Hermes prompt
shape (`FINAL_ANSWER` JSON block, claim schema, expected stdout
contract) when the corpus and feed flip are ready.

### Not in this release

- A populated production corpus. Real rows live in
  operator-controlled private storage (see
  `docs/v3/corpus/PRIVATE_CORPUS_STORAGE.md`).
- Mainnet v3 emissions. Flag and weight both default off; live-feed
  enablement is gated on the operator preflight ritual in
  `src/cathedral/v3/corpus/CORPUS_TODO.md`.

## v1.1.7 - Prober: hermes chat -q (full agentic loop)

**Date:** 2026-05-13

**Headline:** The SSH prober now invokes `hermes chat -q` (full agentic
loop with tool calls + skill execution + multiple model turns + memory
reads) instead of `hermes -z` (one-shot `model.generate(prompt)` with
no agent loop). Cathedral's value prop is verifying the agent actually
did work — fetching source URLs, calling tools, reasoning across
turns. The `-z` invocation stripped exactly that out.

### Fixed

- **Prober no longer bypasses the Hermes agent loop.** `hermes -z` was
  a one-shot model call: no tool calls, no skill execution, no URL
  fetching, no memory reads. Iota1's test tonight (submission
  `13bb4a12`) confirmed the failure mode: Hermes returned "I apologize
  for the difficulties in accessing real-time information about
  Article 5 of the AI Act..." because `-z` doesn't run the agent that
  would have fetched the source. v1.1.7 switches to `hermes chat -q`,
  which runs the full Hermes agent loop end-to-end.
- **Trace bundles now capture the full tool-call history.** Request
  dumps, session messages, and the SQLite slice now reflect a real
  agentic run rather than a single API call. Proof-of-loop counts
  (`tool_call_count`, `api_call_count`, `tool_calls_observed`) become
  the real verifiable-work signal.

### Changed

- **`SshHermesRunnerConfig.eval_timeout_secs` default raised from 120s
  to 300s.** The agentic loop has to think, call tools, wait for tool
  results, and think again, so the one-shot 120s budget is too tight.
  The orchestrator's `CATHEDRAL_SSH_EVAL_TIMEOUT` env default also
  moves from 600s → 300s for consistency (was already 600s in the
  env-driven path).
- **Dropped `SshHermesRunnerConfig.eval_max_turns` and the
  `CATHEDRAL_HERMES_MAX_TURNS` env wrapper.** `hermes chat -q` has no
  equivalent CLI flag, and we want the full agentic loop now rather
  than a single-turn cap. The old field was already inert on Hermes
  0.13.0 (the `--max-turns` flag does not exist in 0.13.0; v1.1.5
  stopped passing it).

### For miners

No miner-side change required. The same `~/.hermes/` skills you've
already shipped now get exercised by the agent during the eval round.
If your `soul.md` instructs the agent to cite sources, the agent will
now actually fetch those sources rather than hallucinating around the
gap. Trace bundles get richer; scoring weights are unchanged.

## v1.1.4 — Miner-onboard UX: resubmits + public failed-evals

**Date:** 2026-05-12

**Headline:** Two production UX fixes from tonight's first-miner
onboarding pass. Miners can resubmit under their own hotkey after a
failed eval without inventing new display_names, and the public API
now exposes failed eval attempts so the leaderboard's empty-state can
surface real network activity even before any agent scores above zero.

### Fixed

- **Same-hotkey resubmits are no longer blocked by the 7-day fuzzy
  display_name dedupe.** The check was intended to stop OTHER miners
  from squatting an existing display_name; a miner resubmitting under
  their own hotkey (e.g. after a failed eval) should not have to mint
  `McDEE-v2` / `McDEE-v3` / etc to bypass their own prior rows. The
  fuzzy candidate set now excludes the submitter's own hotkey. The
  cross-hotkey squat path is unchanged: a different miner submitting
  the same or fuzzy-close display_name within 7 days is still
  rejected (`status=rejected` with `rejection_reason` set).

### New

- **`GET /api/cathedral/v1/cards/{card_id}/attempts?limit=20`** — public
  endpoint returning recent `eval_runs` for a card INCLUDING failed
  ones (`_ssh_hermes_failed=true` and/or `weighted_score=0`). Same
  per-row shape as `/feed` plus a `miner_hotkey` field for
  attribution. Ordered `ran_at DESC`, default 20 rows, max 200. Lets
  the public leaderboard surface real network activity even before
  any submission scores above zero (cathedralai/cathedral PR #119
  empty-state design).

### For miners

If your eval failed and you want to resubmit under the same display_name,
just do it — same hotkey, same name, different bundle is now the normal
recovery path. No need to suffix v2 / v3 / etc.

## v1.0.7 - ssh-probe runtime scaffolding

**Date:** 2026-05-12

**Headline:** Cathedral landed the runtime scaffolding for bundle-based
miners and ssh-probe verification. Current v1 mining uses BYO Box:
Cathedral SSHs into the miner's host, invokes Hermes, captures the trace,
and scores the returned card through the standard Cathedral signing chain.
Polaris deployment code stayed gated and is not documented as a live miner
path.

### New

- **BYO Box - `ssh-probe`**: miner runs Hermes themselves on any host with
  SSH access. They authorize Cathedral by adding the platform SSH key
  (`/.well-known/cathedral-ssh-key.pub`) to `authorized_keys`. Cathedral
  SSHs in, invokes Hermes for the eval, captures the trace, and scores the
  returned card. The live v1 runtime multiplier is 1.00x.
- **Polaris deploy scaffolding**: `polaris-deploy` runner code landed, but
  the mode is gated off in v1 production until isolation and economics are
  ready.
- **Submit endpoint** accepts `attestation_mode` (`polaris-deploy` /
  `ssh-probe` / `tee` / `unverified` / `bundle`) plus optional
  `ssh_host` / `ssh_port` / `ssh_user` / `hermes_port` for BYO Box
  registration.
- **`PolarisDeployRunner`** and **`SshProbeRunner`** added under
  `cathedral.eval.*`. Both produce the canonical `PolarisRunResult` shape;
  scoring + signing path is unchanged.
- **Hermes bundle ingest**: the Polaris-deployed Hermes container fetches
  the encrypted bundle from R2 at startup, decrypts with the env-injected
  KEK + `encryption_key_id`, and extracts into its profile dir. Skills /
  AGENTS.md / soul.md become the running agent's identity.
- **Structured execution trace** in the `/chat` response: tool calls
  (redacted args schema), model calls (model + tokens + latency), agentic
  loop depth, start/end timestamps. Persisted to `eval_runs.trace_json` as
  an unsigned sidecar so old validators continue to verify signatures
  unchanged.
- **CHECK constraint widening** for `agent_submissions.attestation_mode`
  via a 12-step SQLite ALTER procedure (the previous constraint rejected
  `polaris-deploy` and `ssh-probe` on legacy volumes; SQLite cannot ALTER
  a CHECK in place).
- **Site additions**: `/verification` page enumerates exactly what each
  signature attests + what v1 does NOT yet verify; submit form on
  `/jobs/<id>/submit` now has a verification-mode picker that conditionally
  reveals SSH coordinates for BYO Box.
- **`docs/VALIDATOR.md`** + **`docs/validator/RUNBOOK.md`** updated for
  the v2 dispatch flow.
- **Universal Cathedral SSH key** published at
  `https://api.cathedral.computer/.well-known/cathedral-ssh-key.pub` for
  free-tier miner installation.

### Changed

- Default `attestation_mode` was widened for bundle-based miners instead of
  legacy `polaris`. Current v1 production defaults to `ssh-probe`; Polaris
  deploy modes remain gated.
- Publisher dispatcher (`_runner_for`) now routes all five attestation
  modes correctly; previously only `polaris` and `tee` were wired.
- Polaris's `TemplateDeploymentRequest.validate_parameters` widened to
  admit base64 (`+ /`) and URL query (`? & % # ~`) characters in
  `env_vars` values so presigned URLs and wrapped keys can pass through
  to the spawned Hermes container.

### Operational

- `ghcr.io/cathedralai/cathedral-runtime:v1.0.7` published + public.
- Railway env on `cathedral-publisher`:
  - `CATHEDRAL_PIN_CHUTES_KEY=true` (Cathedral forwards its Chutes key
    to spawned Hermes containers for gated Polaris deployment tests).
  - `CATHEDRAL_PROBE_SSH_PUBLIC_KEY` set to the platform-wide pubkey.

### Known limitations

- Live verification chain (`set_weights` on SN292 testnet, weekly Merkle
  anchor on chain) wired in code but not yet running against the live
  publisher signature stream.
- v1 runtime treats `soul.md` as the LLM system prompt rather than
  spinning up the full Hermes agentic loop with tool routing. v2.1 closes
  that gap (tracked in `cathedral-redesign/OBSERVABILITY_V2.md`).
- BYO Box ssh-probe live miner pipeline is in code + tested.

### For miners

Start here: `curl https://api.cathedral.computer/skill.md`.

Current live path: rent or own a box with Hermes running, register SSH
coordinates with your submission, install the platform SSH key in
`authorized_keys`.

### For validators

`docs/validator/RUNBOOK.md` is the canonical setup guide.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cathedralai/cathedral
cd cathedral
bash scripts/provision_validator.sh
```

Validators verify the Cathedral signature on every `EvalRun` projection
locally against a pinned pubkey. Polaris attestations and miner-hotkey
signatures are verified upstream by the publisher.

### Signed commits

Every commit landing on `main` from 2026-05-12 onward is SSH-signed and
shows as "Verified" on GitHub, so validators auditing the source tree can
trust each revision back to a known maintainer key.
