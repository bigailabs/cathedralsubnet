"""Arena — the miner-facing simulation surface for v4.

Exposes the three atomic tool operations a miner agent runtime is
allowed to call against a scrambled micro-repository workspace:

  * ``read_file``
  * ``write_patch``
  * ``run_local_compile``

Also exposes the ``IsomorphicScrambler``, which loads a base repo from
``vault/`` and produces a structurally-equivalent but lexically
scrambled workspace from a deterministic seed.
