"""Oracle — the validator-side hermetic patch runner.

The oracle is the only path that runs miner-submitted patches against
the hidden verification test. It is designed for a hard sub-200ms
budget and a 100% offline runtime: no docker, no firecracker, no
network, no host filesystem writes outside ``/dev/shm`` (or the
platform tmpfs equivalent).
