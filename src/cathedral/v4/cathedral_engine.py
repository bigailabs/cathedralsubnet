"""CathedralEngine — the v4 publisher-side challenge runtime.

**Architectural position (REVISED 2026-05-17):**

v4 is a **publisher-side private challenge runtime**. It runs on the
publisher's worker host. It is NOT embedded in the validator loop.

The end-to-end flow:

  1. Publisher loads a synthetic row from private operator storage
     (``CATHEDRAL_V4_CORPUS_PATH``) — never from the public repo.
  2. Publisher calls
     ``engine.build_miner_bundle(task)`` which loads the upstream
     micro-repo from ``vault/``, scrambles it, **applies the bug
     patch server-side**, and emits a tarball/dict of broken-state
     files that the miner can read. **The raw bug patch is never
     shipped to the miner.**
  3. Publisher gives the broken bundle to a miner and receives back a
     unified-diff fix patch plus the recorded tool trace.
  4. Publisher calls
     ``engine.verify_miner_submission(broken_state, fix_patch,
     hidden_test)`` which runs in the bounded publisher-side oracle
     (network-isolated, rlimit-bounded subprocess on tmpfs scratch).
  5. Publisher calls
     ``engine.package_elite_telemetry(raw_payload)`` to produce the
     canonical ``ValidationPayload`` envelope with deterministic
     hash.
  6. Publisher signs the row via ``cathedral.v4.sign.build_signed_v4_row``
     (which delegates to the existing v3 ``EvalSigner`` rather than
     reinventing signing) and persists it. The validator pulls the
     signed row, verifies the signature, and reads the score. **The
     validator never executes any of this code.**

Two perf budgets (per the revised spec, see
``cathedral.v4.oracle.patch_runner``):

  * ``BOOKKEEPING_BUDGET_SECONDS = 0.20`` — engine-only bookkeeping
    (load, scramble, build bundle, hash, package telemetry, sign).
    Asserted by ``tests/v4/test_benchmark.py::test_bookkeeping_*``.
  * ``REPRO_BUDGET_SECONDS = 3.0`` — the actual subprocess that runs
    the hidden test on the publisher worker. Asserted by
    ``tests/v4/test_benchmark.py::test_repro_*``.

**Siphon rule.** Trajectories with a single-turn SUCCESS outcome are
flagged: a one-shot fix has no multi-step trace, which means the
publisher cannot learn anything from it for the data moat, and it is
the canonical answer-sharing signature. The flag is computed in
``siphon_flags_for(payload)`` and not baked into the payload itself
(payloads are immutable once signed; flagging is publisher-side
audit metadata).
