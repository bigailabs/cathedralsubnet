"""Validator pull loop — `GET /v1/leaderboard/recent` from the publisher.

Per CONTRACTS.md Section 6 (validator side):
- Validator binary polls publisher's leaderboard/recent every 30s
- For each new entry: verify cathedral signature, verify against last
  known Merkle root from on-chain
- Persist to validator's local DB
- Existing weight_loop reads from validator's local DB and sets weights

For v1 the validator's "local DB" is the existing sqlite — we add a
`scores` row keyed by `miner_hotkey` so the existing weight_loop keeps
working without modification. The publisher signs each `EvalRun`
record; the validator verifies with the Cathedral public key (loaded
from the publisher's `/.well-known/cathedral-jwks.json`, or directly
from `CATHEDRAL_PUBLIC_KEY_HEX` for now).

       with an empty id, regardless of what rows are already in

       (cheap optimization on top of the upsert's idempotence).

       Sub-case B': if the highest persisted ran_at is older than the
