"""Signed-payload versioning constants for the eval wire shape.

Lives in its own module so cross-branch tests can import the
``_SIGNED_KEYS_BY_VERSION`` map and ``_card_excerpt`` projection
without dragging the full publisher import chain
(scoring_pipeline → publisher.repository → publisher.app →
orchestrator → scoring_pipeline).

CROSS-BRANCH CONTRACT: the keysets in ``_SIGNED_KEYS_BY_VERSION``
MUST match the same map in ``src/cathedral/validator/pull_loop.py``
(see ``_SIGNED_KEYS_BY_VERSION`` on the validator-compat branch). The
validator dispatches verification by ``eval_output_schema_version``
on each wire item; if our publisher signs a different field set than
the validator verifies, signatures fail at runtime.

Coordinated under cathedralai/cathedral#75 PR 4 +
feature/v1-1-0-validator-compat. Any change to v1 OR v2 here MUST
land in lockstep with the validator branch.
