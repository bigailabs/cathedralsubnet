"""Eval-artifact bundle publisher (cathedralai/cathedral#75, PR 3).

Takes the ``TraceBundle`` produced by ``SshHermesRunner.run()``
(PR 2 — a tar.gz of Hermes state.db slice + session JSONs +
request_dumps + memories + skills + logs, plus a manifest dict),
encrypts the bundle bytes, uploads to Hippius under a separate
``eval-artifacts/`` prefix, signs the manifest with Cathedral's
Ed25519 eval signing key, uploads the signed manifest as a sibling
JSON object, and returns a ``PublishedArtifact`` carrying:

- the canonical ``manifest_hash`` (blake3 of canonical-JSON manifest)
  — this is the value PR 4 will sign as
  ``eval_artifact_manifest_hash`` in the v2 signed payload
- the ``bundle_url`` and ``manifest_url`` (s3:// URIs) — these go in
  PR 4's UNSIGNED response envelope per the Q4 contract; the
  validator verifies bundle integrity by re-hashing on download,
  not by trusting URL identity

Trust model:

- Hippius CIDs / S3 URIs can rotate. We don't sign URLs.
- The bundle bytes are addressable by their blake3 hash, embedded
  inside the manifest. The manifest's hash is what gets signed.
- A validator that downloads the bundle can re-hash it and verify
  the bytes match the manifest's ``bundle_blake3``. If they don't,
  the artifact is treated as tampered regardless of URL provenance.

Scope guardrails:

- Does NOT modify ``eval_runs`` schema (PR 4 territory).
- Does NOT plumb URLs into any wire response yet (PR 4 territory).
- Does NOT change the signed payload (PR 4 + validator-compat).
- Returns artifacts the orchestrator/scoring_pipeline will consume
  in PR 4. Until then this publisher is invoked but its output goes
  into a sidecar table-or-file (see ``persist_artifact_record``).

    Fields:

    - ``manifest_hash`` — blake3 hex of the canonical-JSON of the
      *signed* manifest body (which itself contains the
      ``bundle_blake3`` over the encrypted bundle bytes). This is the
      value PR 4 will put in ``_SIGNED_KEYS_BY_VERSION[2]`` as
      ``eval_artifact_manifest_hash``. Any tampering with the
      manifest contents — file list, sha256s, proof_of_loop fields,
      or the bundle hash inside it — flips this value.

    - ``manifest_url`` — Hippius/S3 URI for the signed manifest JSON
      (a small object, KB-scale). Goes in the UNSIGNED envelope.

    - ``bundle_url`` — Hippius/S3 URI for the encrypted bundle bytes
      (MB-scale tar.gz, encrypted). Goes in the UNSIGNED envelope.

    - ``manifest_signature`` — base64-encoded Ed25519 signature over
      ``canonical_json(manifest_body)``. Validators verify against
      Cathedral's pinned public key. Bundled here for completeness;
      PR 4's signed payload references ``manifest_hash`` rather than
      the signature directly.

    - ``manifest_body`` — the in-memory canonical manifest dict, also
      stored inside the uploaded manifest object. Returned for
      callers that need to inspect the manifest without a round trip
      to Hippius.
